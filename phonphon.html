							<h1>Research in phonetics, phonology and prosody</h1>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/sajmaltyox_long.png" alt="" /></span>
							<p>My doctoral research has focused on the phonetics and phonology of Chichicastenango K'iche', including topics such as vowel quality, stress, vowel deletion, glottalization and intonation. I have also participated in two collaborative projects: one on the perception of glottalization in disambiguating ambiguous phrase boundaries in English and Spanish, and another on the production of glottal fricatives in Yucatec Maya.</p>
							<p><b>Vowels</b> <br><span class="image right"><img src="images/tenselaxpairs.png" alt="" /></span>Most dialects of K'iche' have a contrast between long vowels, as in chaaj 'ashes', and short vowels, as in chaj 'pine tree'. The Chichicastenango dialect is different: historically long vowels are produced as ''tense'' vowels and historically short vowels are produced as ''lax'' vowels, with a change in quality. Through a vowel production experiment I learned that the differnce between tense and lax vowels is that the lax vowels are each articulated in a more centralized position as compared to their tense pair. Additionally, the lax high front vowel shows signs of having merged with the tense high front vowel /i/ and /the lax central vowel /É™/.</p>
							<p><b>Stress</b> <br> Nearly all described varieties of K'iche' have stress that falls on the last syllable of the word, with few exceptions. In Chichicastenango K'iche' this is not the case; rather, verbs often have stress on an earlier syllable if it is heavy (has a tense vowel or a coda consonant).</p> 
							<p><b>Vowel deletion</b> <br> Many vowels are deleted in Chichicastenango K'iche', resulting in complex consonant clusters. Vowels are typically deleted if they are lax, unstressed, and in non-final CV syllables.</p> 
							<p><b>Glottalization</b> <br>It is commonly believed that all otherwise vowel-initial words begin with a glottal stop in Mayan languages. Through a study of full closures and acoustic cues to glottalized voice quality in a corpus of spontaneous speech I show that in Chichicastenango K'iche' not all vowel-initial words have an initial glottal stop. Rather, there is greater glottalization on words that have initial stress or are preceded by a vowel, a glottalized consonant or a pause. Vowels that occur in the initial position of the intoantional phrase are also more glottalized throughout, indicating an IP-initial phonetic marker that enhances the boundaries between phrases.</p> 
							<p><b>Status suffixes and intonational phrasing</b> <br> Many different morphemes in K'iche' have 'phrase-final' and 'phrase-medial' forms; that is, what the word looks like depends on its position in the phrase. It is debated in the literature whether phrase-final forms occurs at the end of a syntactic constituent (the clause) or a prosodic constituent (the intonational phrase). Based on data from a corpus of spontaneous narratives I show that phrase-final forms do not quite line up with either clause boundaries nor IP boundary tones. I argue that the distrubution is prosodic and occurs in IP-final position, whereas the positions of boundary tones are restricted to the ends of the highest IP in a recursive structure. </p>
