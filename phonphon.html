							<h1>Research in phonetics, phonology and prosody</h1>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/sajmaltyox_long.png" alt="" /></span>
							<p>My doctoral research is on the phonetics and phonology of Chichicastenango K'iche', with a particular focus on prosody. Specific topics addressed include vowel quality, stress, vowel deletion, voice quality and intonation. I have also participated in collaborative projects on the perception of laryngealization in English and Spanish and on the production of glottal fricatives in Yucatec Maya.</p>
							<p><b>Tense and lax vowels in Chichicastenango K'iche'</b><br>In the Chichicastenango dialect of K'iche' there is a contrast between two groups of vowels, commonly referred to as "tense" and "lax", which resulted from a historic contrast in vowel length. Through a vowel production experiment I showed that the lax vowels are each articulated in a more centralized position as compared to their tense pair, and there are no consistent duration differences between them. Additionally, the lax high front vowel shows signs of having merged with the tense high front vowel /i/ and the lax central vowel /É™/.</p>

							<p><b>Glottalization in Chichicastenango K'iche'</b><br> It is commonly stated that all otherwise vowel-initial words begin with a glottal stop in Mayan languages. Through a study of full closures and acoustic measures of voice quality in a corpus of spontaneous speech I show that in Chichicastenango K'iche' not all vowel-initial words have an initial glottal stop. Rather, there is greater glottalization at the beginning of initial vowels that are stressed or are preceded by a pause or a word ending in a vowel or glottalized consonant. This is consistent with the existence of a word-initial glottal stop segment in these positions that is frequently reduced in naturalistic speech. Vowels that occur in the initial position of the intoantional phrase, in contrast, have greater glottalization throughout, indicating a different type of effect. This IP-initial variation in voice quality enhances the boundary between phrases.</p>

							<p><b>Phrase-final morphemes and intonational phrasing in Chichicastenango K'iche'</b> <br> Many different morphemes in K'iche' have 'phrase-final' and 'phrase-medial' forms; that is, the form of the morpheme depends on its position in the phrase. It is debated in the literature whether phrase-final forms occurs at the end of a syntactic constituent (the clause) or a prosodic constituent (the intonational phrase). Based on data from a corpus of spontaneous narratives I show that the phrase-final forms of a set of verbal suffixes called status suffixes do not correlate perfectly with either clause boundaries nor IP-final boundary tones. I argue that the distrubution is nevertheless prosodic and occurs in IP-final position but does not match the positions of boundary tones because these are restricted to the ends of the highest IP in a recursive structure. </p> 
						
							<p><b>Perception of laryngealization in English and Spanish</b> <br>In a collaborative project with Dr. Megan Crowhurst and Mackenzie Walters, we investigated the use of laryngealized voicing and duration a perceptual cues to phrase boundaries in ambiguous contexts with monolingual and bilingual speakers of English and Spanish. Results of the experiment showed that each of the groups of listeners were more likely to judge the existence of a phonological phrase boundary after a word when it was longer or produced with creaky voice. We also found differences between the behavior of bilingual listeners and monolingual listeners of the same language.</p>
